# Online Training

MIT-licensed, self-hosted software for bilingual teaching, course access approval, discussions, notes and time-limited reading links. Optional [managed hosting](https://training.seii.top/) is a separate service; self-hosted installations have no hosting subscription requirement. Dependencies retain their own licenses.

## Start

Node.js 24 is required.

    npm ci
    npm start

The default listener is http://127.0.0.1:3140. Open /admin to sign in. On first startup, initial administrator credentials are written to runtime/admin-access.txt; keep this file private. Runtime data is excluded from Git.

A new installation contains no courses or teaching materials. Create a course in the administrator console, choose its access code, upload Chinese and English Markdown files, review the draft, then publish explicitly. Uploading never publishes automatically. Course codes select a course; they do not bypass identity verification or access approval.

## Materials and teaching

Materials belong to the deployment operator and are uploaded after installation. This repository contains no customer curriculum, internal document paths or product teaching content. See [Markdown format](MARKDOWN_FORMAT.md) for the upload contract and [user guide](USER_GUIDE.md) for classroom workflows.

Chinese and English pages use matching stable IDs. Business versions and content revisions are independent. Replacing a draft, publishing a revision or reorganizing pages preserves prior learning records. Notes, questions and annotations remain associated with their original pages.

The classroom includes a resizable presentation workspace, independent browser tabs, full-window Mermaid diagrams and a mobile layout. External sites may disallow embedding; open them in a separate window in that case.

## Access and collaboration

Administrators configure course permissions, instructors, user security resets, sharing permissions and publication. Learners can discuss, annotate, attach compressed images and keep private notes. Visibility rules apply to replies, attachments, exports and pinned discussions.

Shared reading links have bounded lifetimes and administrator approval controls. Reading analytics are engagement indicators, not proof of learning. Optional Lark integration and scoped agent APIs require configuration and authorization.

## Deployment and verification

Set PUBLIC_URL to your HTTPS origin, RUNTIME_DIR to a private persistent directory, and PORT/HOST as needed. See [deployment](ops/README.md) for proxy, backup and container setup.

    npm test
    npm run check

Browser tests require Playwright and an installed browser. Set PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE and CHROME_PATH if needed. Tests generate synthetic placeholder records; they do not use customer materials or production data.

Never commit credentials, runtime databases, uploads, private documents or browser session files. Back up runtime data before upgrades and verify restoration separately.
